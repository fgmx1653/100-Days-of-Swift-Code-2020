Welcome back ladies and gentlemen, in this git repository I will be posting code for the next 100 days! 
If you want you can check out the videos on my YouTube channel [A Swiftly Tilting Planet 100 days of code playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLomLuS7LD16doB7_VAWRCI8Zu5QAR3pfK).

## Day 001 – Hello, World!

Just getting everything set up for the next 100 days of code, and starting to go through [Paul's](https://twitter.com/twostraws) [Swift in Sixty Seconds](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/review) interactive review.

Worked with [Simple Types](https://github.com/calebrwells/100-Days-of-Swift-Code-2020/blob/master/Swift/MyPlayground.playground/Contents.swift) in Swift.

I also started making a simple [watchOS app](https://github.com/calebrwells/100-Days-of-Swift-Code-2020/tree/master/Apps/watchOS/Countdown%20Timer).

```swift
let greeting = "Hello, World!"
``` 

## Day 002 – Complex Data Types && a SwiftUI Game?

More Swift, and playing with some SwiftUI game ideas.
