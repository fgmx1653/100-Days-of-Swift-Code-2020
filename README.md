Welcome back ladies and gentlemen, in this git repository I will be posting code for the next 100 days!

## Day 001 – Hello, World!

Just getting everything set up for the next 100 days of code, and starting to go through [Paul's](https://twitter.com/twostraws) [Swift in Sixty Seconds](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/review) interactive review.

Worked with [Simple Types](https://github.com/calebrwells/100-Days-of-Swift-Code-2020/blob/master/Swift/MyPlayground.playground/Contents.swift) in Swift.

I also started making a simple [watchOS app](https://github.com/calebrwells/100-Days-of-Swift-Code-2020/tree/master/Apps/watchOS/Countdown%20Timer).

I need to look into the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) more before I continue work on the watch app as I wanted to use the [Time Swift package](https://github.com/davedelong/time) by [Dave](https://twitter.com/davedelong), but having issues with editing the Package.swift dependencies. This [article](https://useyourloaf.com/blog/editing-a-swift-package/) looks like a good place to start.

```swift
let greeting = "Hello, World!"
```
